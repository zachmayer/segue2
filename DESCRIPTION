Description: A segue into parallel processing on Amazon's Web Services. Includes a parallel lapply function for the Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) engine. This is NOT a map reduce project but it uses Hadoop Streaming on Amazon's EMR in order to get simple parallel computation ala cart. This is NOT a big data package. If you are CPU bound this might be a useful package. If you are IO bound, this is not the package you are looking for.
